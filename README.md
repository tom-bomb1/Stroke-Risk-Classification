# Stroke-Risk-Classification
Developed stroke prediction models using XGBoost to maximize patient risk identification. Engineered features via PCA and L1 regularization, achieving highest recall with XGBoost (94.8%) on reduced features. Compared bias-variance tradeoffs to optimize medical intervention strategies using Python and Scikit-learn.
